# EssentialFacts

Think you know your U.S. history and government? Then who were the Founding Father of our nation? How many voting members are there in the House of Representatives? How many amendments does the Constitution have?

Only one in three Americans (36 percent) can actually pass a multiple choice test consisting of items taken from the U.S. Citizenship Test, 
which has a passing score of 60, according to a national survey released on October 18, 2019 by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation.

Unbelievable!

Essential Facts serves to educate both Americans and immigrants alike on U.S history and government and ensure (one person at a time) that 
the statistic changes for the better when taken again in the future."
